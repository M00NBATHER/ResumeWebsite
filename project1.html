            <h1>A project I did goes here or something</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Live Demo?</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Source code?</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If I could finish a project I would put it on GIT and the links above would actually do something and take you there.</p>
            <p>Then I'd talk about it here, probably...</p>
            <p>or potentially even do something cool on the page, like effects and neat functions or whatever.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>And then I would make some points about it</li>
                <li>Like this</li>
                <li>And also this</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Anyways here's a picture I thought was cool that I had saved on my PC but do not own the rights to:</p>
